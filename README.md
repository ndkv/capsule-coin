Sure thing! Follow along and you will swiftly be the owner of the venerable Capsule coins:

1. install the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
2. create an account
3. switch to the `Rinkeby` network
4. send us (@ndkv) your account address and we will swiftly transfer 100 Capsule Coins (CECs).

That's it!

## Thanks... I guess. Now what? üôÑ

Go to the mega awesome [Capsule Coin √êapp](https://ndkv.github.io/capsule-coin), unlock your Metamask account and be awed by them coinz! ü§Ø

Make sure to bookmark our √êapp because in the future you will be able to

- share your coins with others!
- see a list of accounts that have Capsule Coins!

Can you collect the most coins?

## Is this for real, tho? ü§î

Yes, we are extremely passionate about our vision and dedicated to executing it swiftly. Verify for yourself:

- inspect the underlying [Smart Contract](https://github.com/ndkv/capsule-coin/blob/master/contracts/CapsuleCoin.sol) in this repository
- inspect the deployed contract on the [Ethereum Rinkeby blockchain](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x138db7ce2af44c6c3ccb1589dfe223f15a7ef750)
- inspect the [Node.js script](https://github.com/ndkv/capsule-coin/blob/master/scripts/CapsuleCoin.js) we use to distribute the coins
- verify that the account holding the Capsule Coins is [actually distributing them](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x245f73498be5c1767570d687263c6ef368df62cd#tokentxns).
- inspect our √êapp's [source code](https://github.com/ndkv/capsule-coin/tree/gh-pages) over in the `gh-pages` branch
- read on for detailed (and serious) instructions on how to create your very own coin

See, we mean business!

# I'd like a coin and a √êapp of my own, please! üôã

Great, let's get you started. In the following we'll show you how to craft a smart contract, publish it to the Ethereum test network and interact with it with JavaScript.

Head over to the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/ndkv/capsule-coin/tree/gh-pages) to get your hands on our √êapp's source code. √êapps are decentralized applications that run in the web browser and can interact with the Ethereum network. √êapps. Are. The. Future.

## Basic workflow

To deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum network we need to

1. write a contract in Solidity
2. compile the contract
3. publish the contract to the network

Afterwards we can interact with it through e.g. Node.js scripts or a √êapp.

## Truffle

Truffle is a JavaScript framework for crafting, testing and deploying smart contracts. It makes the whole process much more bearable than going at it with Ethereum's stock tooling.

    npm install -g truffle

This will install the `truffle` CLI and give you access to the following Truffle operations

- `init` - [initiates an empty Truffle project](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/project) that contains `contracts/`, `migrations/`, `test/` and `truffle.js`.
- `compile` - compiles your Solidity contracts in `contract/` and puts them in `build/contracts/`
- `migrate` - publishes the compiled contract on the Ethereum blockchain

Execute `truffle <command>` to execute one of these operations.

### Writing, compiling and testing contracts

Contracts are written in [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/). The CapsuleCoin contract is located in `contracts/CapsuleCoin.sol`. You will notice it has three functions

- `CapsuleCoin()` - this is the constructor. It is called once when the contract is published. In our case it mints 10000 coins and gives them to the account publishing the contract.
- `sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount)` - sends `amount` of coins to `receiver` address.
- `getBalance(address addr)` - get the balance of `address`.

Before we can publish this contract to the network we need to compile it with

    truffle compile

This generates a `build/contract/CapsuleCoin.json` file that contains your compiled contract, its Application Binary Interface (ABI) and some other metadata.

The ABI describes the interface of your contract. Take note of its existence and location as you will need it when you want to interact with your contract.

Pushing to a live chain is a slow process (you need to wait for your contract to be mined). Luckily, Truffle comes with two local blockchains you can use to develop and test your contract more effectively: Ganachi and `truffle develop`.

### Publishing to a live network

To publish your contract on one of the public Ethereum networks we need to install and run a *gasp* real Ethereum node and tell Truffle to use it.

#### Install and test an Ethereum node

First, let's install and run the node. `geth` seems to be the most popular implementation. You can install it on macOS with `brew`

```bash
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install ethereum
```

Executing

    geth --rinkeby --datadir=$HOME/.rinkeby --verbosity 2 console

will launch an Ethereum node on your machine at `127.0.0.1:8545` which is connected to the `Rinkeby` test network and drop you in a JavaScript console.

The console exposes Ethereum's [web3.js JavaScript API](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/). web3 is awesome as it allows us to interact with the network using JavaScript (yes, also in the browser!), see `Interacting with your contracts` section.

#### Create an account

Contracts are published and owned by an Ethereum account. Right now our node doesn't have one: execute `web3.eth.accounts` in the console to verify. You should get an empty list.

Let's create an account. Hit `Ctrl + C` to stop the node/console and execute

`geth account new`

to create a new account. Remember the password and note the address; you will need both later.

#### Get some fake Ether

[Publishing and interacting with contracts costs Ether](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/contracts). We can get some for the test network for free from the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Send them to your newly made account.

#### Publish your contract with Truffle `migrate`

Execute `truffle migrate` to publish a contract to the network. You will need

1. a running node that allows RPC connections
2. an unlocked account on that node
3. the correct Truffle configuration

1 and 2 are solved by running our Ethereum node with the following parameters

    geth --rinkeby --rpc --datadir=$HOME/.rinkeby --unlock <your_ethereum_account> --verbosity 2 console

where

- `--rpc` enables the Remote Procedure Call interface that Truffle uses to interact with the network
- `-- unlock` specifies the account that will be used to publish the contract. Replace `<your_ethereum_account` with the account you created earlier. You will be prompted for your password.

`truffle-example.js` contains the required configuration: rename it to `truffle.js` and execute

    truffle migrate rinkeby

Truffle will compile your contract and publish it! Furthermore, it will store your contract's address in `build/contracts/` so you don't need to remember it. So. Much. Awesome.

### Interacting with your contracts

Once a contract is published you can interact with it through the awesome [truffle-contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract) module. Get it from NPM

    npm install truffle-contract

`require` it in your Node scripts, feed it your contract's ABI located in `build/contracts/CapsuleCoin.js`, obtain an instance of your published contract and call its functions directly in JS. It's magic/the future/mindblowing!

Check out `scripts/CapsuleCoin.js` for the exact workflow.

## Bare metal

Don't like frameworks? Fine, but here be dragons 'cause you have to do most of the stuffs on your own.

### Install all the stuffs on MacOS

Install the Ethereum node `geth` and the Solidity compiler `solc` with `brew`

```bash
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install ethereum
brew install solidity
brew linkapps solidity
```

#### Compile your contract

Compile your contract with `solc` as

```bash
echo "var testOutput=`solc --optimize --combined-json abi,bin,interface hello-world.sol`" > hello-world.js
```

#### Publish your contract

Start the `geth` console (see above) and execute the following

```javascript

loadScript('contracts/hello-world.js');

var testContract = web3.eth.contract(JSON.parse(testOutput.contracts["hello-world.sol:HelloWorld"].abi));

personal.unlockAccount(eth.accounts[0], "{top secret password}");

var test = testContract.new({ from: eth.accounts[1], data: "0x" + testOutput.contracts["hello-world.sol:HelloWorld"].bin, gas: 4700000},
  function (e, contract) {
    console.log(e, contract);
    if (typeof contract.address !== 'undefined') {
         console.log('Contract mined! address: ' + contract.address + ' transactionHash: ' + contract.transactionHash);
    }
});
```

Take note of the contract's address. You can put the above in a JavaScript file and `require` it in the `geth` console but Truffle is much more elegant. Use it. And call it awesome all the time.
